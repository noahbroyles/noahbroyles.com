<h1>Getting Started with Jekyll</h1>

<p class="view">by Noah Broyles</p>

<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hi, "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>prints <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hi, Tom!</code> to STDOUT.</p>
